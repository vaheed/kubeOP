# kubeOP Documentation

This site is generated from the current code in this repository. Use the navigation to find operator controllers, CRD schemas, configuration, API endpoints, and operational guidance sourced from the Go packages under `cmd/`, `internal/`, and the Kubernetes manifests in `deploy/`.

- Start with [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) for installation, upgrade, and uninstall workflows.
- Dive into the [Architecture](./architecture.md) to understand the control loops that reconcile kubeOP resources.
- Consult [CRDs](./crds.md) and [Controllers](./controllers.md) for authoritative specs and reconciliation flows.
- Review [Config](./config.md) for every environment variable and CLI flag.
- Use [API](./api.md) for manager HTTP endpoints, and [Operations](./operations.md) for logs, metrics, and runbooks.
